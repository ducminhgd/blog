# Database Part 1: Normalization forms

`1NF` -> `2NF` -> `3NF` -> `BCNF` -> `4NF` -> `5NF` -> `6NF`

## 1NF

A relation is said to be in 1NF only when all the entities of the table contain unique or atomic values.

- Given there is a table

| ID  | Name | Courses |
| --- | ---- | ------- |
| 1   | A    | c1, c2  |
| 2   | E    | c3      |
| 3   | M    | c2, c3  |

- Decompose for 1NF

| ID  | Name | Course |
| --- | ---- | ------ |
| 1   | A    | c1     |
| 1   | A    | c2     |
| 2   | E    | c3     |
| 3   | M    | c2     |
| 3   | M    | c3     |

## 2NF

A relation is said to be in 2NF only if it is in 1NF and all the non-key attribute of the table is fully dependent on the primary key.

- Given there is a table

| Student ID | Course ID | Course fee |
| ---------- | --------- | ---------- |
| 1          | C1        | 1000       |
| 2          | C2        | 1500       |
| 1          | C4        | 2000       |
| 4          | C3        | 1000       |
| 4          | C1        | 1000       |
| 2          | C5        | 2000       |

- Decompose for 2F: 2 tables

| Student ID | Course ID |
| ---------- | --------- |
| 1          | C1        |
| 2          | C2        |
| 1          | C4        |
| 4          | C3        |
| 4          | C1        |
| 2          | C5        |

| Course ID | Course fee |
| --------- | ---------- |
| C1        | 1000       |
| C2        | 1500       |
| C3        | 1000       |
| C4        | 2000       |
| C5        | 2000       |

## 3NF

A relation is said to be in 3NF only if it is in 2NF and every non-key attribute of the table is not transitively dependent on the primary key.

- Given there is a table

| Rollno | Game       | Feestructure |
| ------ | ---------- | ------------ |
| 1      | Basketball | 500          |
| 2      | Basketball | 500          |

| Cricket    | 600          |
| Tennis     | 400          |

## Boyce Codd Normal Form (BCNF)

It is the higher version of 3Nf which does not have any multiple overlapping candidate keys.

## Fourth Normal Form (4NF)

A table is in 4NF if and only if, for every one of its non-trivial multivalued dependencies X ->> Y, X is a superkeyâ€”that is, X is either a candidate key or a superset thereof.

- Given there is a table:

| Restaurant       | Pizza Variety | Delivery Area |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| A1 Pizza         | Thick Crust   | Springfield   |
| A1 Pizza         | Thick Crust   | Shelbyville   |

| Elite Pizza      | Capital City  |
| Vincenzo's Pizza | Springfield   |
| Vincenzo's Pizza | Shelbyville   |

## Fifth Normal Form (5NF)

A table is said to be in the 5NF if and only if every non-trivial join dependency in that table is implied by the candidate keys. It is the final normal form as far as removing redundancy is concerned.
