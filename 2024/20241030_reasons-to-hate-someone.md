# Reasons to hate someone

> Note: this post is in English because I would like to practice my English writing skill

Let me give you an example with the two most famous soccer players at this generation, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.

> Note 2: the example I use is my own perspective.

There are a lot of people hate Cristiano Ronaldo (or Messi), and from my point of view, I found some reasons:

## Reason #1: One of them is the measurement of the other

Ronaldo is more aggressive and outspoken than Messi. Some of the people they consider that Messi is more gentle, even though they don't love him, they still compare Ronaldo with Messi. If Messi is praised a lot, they have to compare him to Ronaldo, and find some negative points of Ronaldo to criticize him, and vice versa.

## Reason #2: They hate one because they love the other

Both of them are considered as two rivals, to presentations of the best players of current generation. So, eventhough Ronaldo (or Messi) does not do anything to harm people, if they love Messi (or Ronaldo), they hate the rival of their idol. And, more than that, both of their idols do not hate each other, they respect each other.

This reason also explains thayt they may love one of them just because they hate the other.

## Reason #3: People often find it easier to hate someone than to love them

Hating someone is easier for people. It may not require much reason than loving a person. By hating someone, people are easily blame all their negative emotions to that person. And, hating a famous person is much more easier. Famous people often don't know (and don't care) about the stranger, who hates them.

Hating famous people is actually an expression of jealousy and herd mentality.

## Conclusion

Don't be afraid or curious if someone hates you, most of them have no choice, so that they choose to hate you.
